// Consider the Option type, which wraps a value.
// As an Option, a value is only ever in one of two states:
//      either it is something or it is nothing.


// Provide a way to easily wrap a value as Option.


// Provide a way to run any transformer function for Options which have Some value,
// and simply return None for others.


// Provide a simple way to get at the optional value inside an Option.


// Provide a simple match against the state of the Option.
